AC Selected-1ac_selected.slc-2Andrej Cerjak-3ACSokoban@Yandex.com-4http://sokoban.online.fr-5
This collection is as its name suggests the selection of my best
sokoban puzzles. The puzzles have been created during a long period of
time, some of them more than 15 years ago. Many puzzles almost got
lost (some others did), after creating them I forgot about them and
rediscovered some of them much later only by chance. in order not to
get lost something I enjoyed doing from time to time many years, I
finally decided to make this effort of making final arrangements and
publish them. So here they are, I hope You enjoy solving them :-)
Puzzles are arranged from easier to more challenging, with some
exception - obviously the last one, which is probabli not the most
difficult one, but it certainly requires the largest number of moves
(approx. 15k moves of which 5k pushes) Very easy can be considered
also puzzles 13 & 14 (Butterflies 1&2), while Butterfly 3 requires a
little bit more solving effort. For solving the puzzles at the end of
the collection see also my
  
AC-Smileys-1ac_smileys.slc-2Andrej Cerjak-3ACSokoban@Yandex.com-4http://sokoban.online.fr-5
A small collection in the shape of Smileys, arranged from very easy to
not so easy, the harder ones probably requre a little imagination to
see the Smileys, on the other hand, those are more interesting to
solve ;-)

difficulty. This set is much harder than the previous ones in the

Classic-type levels.That means that goals are not randomly placed all
over the screen, unlike most of the other creators do.Everyone who
played classic 50 levels know what I mean by that.It contains only 3
levels because I want to know what do you think about them and should
I create more.Please tell me what do you think.Thanks
  
The bagatelle collection-1bagatelle.slc-2David Holland-3dholland@dholland.karoo.co.uk-4http://www.ne.jp/asahi/ai/yoshio/sokoban/main.htm-5
Bagatelle is a French word for a trinket, from the Italian for a
conjuror's trick. The collection contains fairly simple puzzles (of
less difficulty than my previous collection maelstrom) of various
sizes. Some of the small puzzles are easier versions of puzzles in my
other collections. Others are my take on some classical Sokoban themes
(goals in a line, in a cross shape, objects outside goal room for
tricky start and finish). The problems posed by each puzzle are of a
fairly straightforward kind, but are nevertheless quite varied. The
puzzles are in roughly ascending order of difficulty.

The Cantrip collection-1cantrip.slc-2David Holland-3dholland@dholland.karoo.co.uk-4http://druille.canalblog.com/albums/jeux/index.html-5
Author's note: The puzzles are all small (between 6 and 9 goals and
pretty cramped), with maze and walls designed by me and
computer-generated start positions. Because of the computer
involvement, the start positions of the puzzles may look abstract or
random. The meat of the puzzles is in the variations, the unexpected
twists, and the underlying problems. The human element of design is
most evident in the solved position, by construction, and I like to
think of the solving process as producing order from chaos. This
collection is meant for experienced solvers, or at least determined
ones, as it contains probably my toughest puzzles so far. As usual I
have tried to put the puzzles in rough ascending order of difficulty,
but here this is even more approximate than usual as I find the
puzzles difficult to compare. The puzzles have been extensively
play-tested. On a good day I can actually solve them...

Choriban Levels-1choriban.slc-2Martí Homs Caussa-3homz70@gmail.com-4http://sapiens.ya.com/sokobanhomz-5
This collection name derives from 'choripan', an spanish word that
means 'sandwich of sausage'. This collection includes two subsets
called 'chorimalism' (7) and 'susi' (10). The 'chorimalism' subset
(that is, minimal levels for Choriban collection) is composed by
levels of 2 boxes, and the subcollection called 'susi' is formed by
levels of small dimensions, experimenting with different number of
boxes, from 2 to 7. The rest of the levels have a small size, normally
with 3 boxes. Finally, the last two levels are based in David W.
Skinner's 'Microban 60', that I have called 'stack-machines'.

The dh1 collection-1dh1.slc-2David Holland-3dholland@dholland.karoo.co.uk-4http://users.bentonrea.com/~sasquatch/sokoban/-5
Author's note: I have experimented with computer-generation for
several of the smaller puzzles hence the "co-authorship" with sokgen
(a computer program of mine). If you like the puzzles email me and if
you have stylistic criticisms direct them to sokgen :-)
  
The dh2 collection-1dh2.slc-2David Holland-3dholland@dholland.karoo.co.uk-4http://users.bentonrea.com/~sasquatch/sokoban/-5
Author's note: There are no computer-generated levels as I am trying
to evolve a puzzle-making style, and so experimenting with as many
different forms as possible. Some of the puzzles are very, or
slightly, symmetrical as a stylistic device (in this I am influenced
by David W. Skinner's excellent Sasquatch puzzle sets at his Sokoban
page). Others are completely unsymmetrical and the style is in the
variations alone.
  
dh5-1dh5.slc-2David Holland-3dholland@dholland.karoo.co.uk-4http://users.bentonrea.com/~sasquatch/sokoban/-5
This is my latest collection. I haven't made puzzles for many years
and forgot how many collections I had published! There is as yet no
dh3 or dh4, until my next collection comes out. The levels are
hand-made with solutions originally found by hand. They have varying
difficulty and are in no particular order

Crazy Monk is Copyright (c) 2008 by Jean-Pierre MARTEL and Matthias
MEGER. These levels may be freely distributed provided they remain
credited with this copyright and all commentaries.

The Disciple levels range from easy to moderately difficult. They have
been designed for Sokoban players who enjoy "optimizing" solutions.
Some levels present an arranged version designed by Matthias Meger
(codified changes). Those remodels are more difficult than the initial
mazes.

Fibonacci Challenge-1fibonacci_challenge.slc-2Kevin Cassol-3kevinccravo@hotmail.com-4http://www.doreen-und-rainer.de-5
A wacky style of playing sokoban: by managing LURD solutions. You can
find the Golden Ratio (phi=1,618...) by dividing the number of moves
of a level by the moves of the previous level. The higher "n" can
reach, closer to "phi" the ratio comes. The same happens to pushes,
box lines, box changes, pushing sessions and player lines. See how
close to the 30-box level you can get solved!

jcd levels-1jcd.slc-2John C Davis-3jcd@ukonline.co.uk-4http://www.virtual-chiswick.ukonline.co.uk-5
There are two different ways of playing Level 2. The first is the
normal way, moving any ball anywhere at any time. The second way,
which is more interesting and difficult, and the way it was designed
to be played, is treating it as eight levels in one. Each letter of
'SOKOBAN!' must be completed before the next is started, using only
the balls arranged below each letter in the shape of that letter.
These can be put into the letter goals in any order. While doing any
letter all the other balls must be considered locked, becoming walls.
After any letter is finished, the balls used for that letter become
locked and the ones in the following letter become unlocked. Your
target is 635 moves (or better!). Instead of doing Level 2 this way as
one big level, you can do it as eight separate levels using levels 3 -
10 to progress automatically. In these the locked balls are walls and
the goals for other letters are floor. This looks a bit peculiar, but
the playability is correct. Note that the start position for the man
for each letter is the end position for one way of doing the previous
letter. You might have done it a different way.... When you've
finished all eight letters, you've earned the right to do the one-push
"small reward" level, where all the balls are shown in their goals,
looking normal again. The last few levels are joke levels, mostly
needing just two clicks to solve. Hey, let the program do the work!

The maelstrom collection-1maelstrm.slc-2David Holland-3dholland@dholland.karoo.co.uk-4http://membres.lycos.fr/nabokos/index.html-5
Author's note: The collection ranges from the pretty small (5 objects,
8x9 squares) through the mid-sized (13 objects, 15x11 squares) right
up to the large (one puzzle with 57 objects 23x24 squares). Just
browse for the kind of challenge you like. The puzzles are in rough
order of difficulty. I designed the maze layout and goals for all the
puzzles, and many but not all of the small puzzles use
computer-generated start positions. A few of the puzzles feature
unexpected twists within lengthy solutions and require substantial
imagination, and the others I hope are at least interesting. A
fully-featured Sokoban player (with drag and drop movement of objects,
mouse movement of the man, ability to keep your place if you quit and
return to the puzzle another time) is strongly recommended for the
medium to larger puzzles, though not strictly necessary.

MF8 Sokoban Competition: The MF8 forum is a forum for all twisty
puzzles. (i.e. Rubik's Cube) In 2009, a sub-forum is created for
Sokoban enthusiasts. The 1st Sokoban competition took place on April
7, 2009.  There is a Sokoban competition about every month.  Everyone
is free to join.  Winners of the competition will get a twisty cube.  
See this page for more details:

the first three competition levels, they are omitted from this set.

Microban-1microban.slc-2David W Skinner-3sasquatch@bentonrea.com-4http://users.bentonrea.com/~sasquatch/sokoban/-5
Microban (155 puzzles, revised April, 2000) This is a good set for
beginners and children. Most of the puzzles are small and illustrate a
particular concept. More experienced players should also find them
interesting, since they are as different from each other as I could
make them given their size. Sokoholics could perhaps time themselves
on completing the whole set. This set also contains puzzles which I
thought were interesting but too easy to include in my regular sets.

Hello to all Sokoban Lovers.I'm an avid player of this mind games.to
date I have more than 8,000 levels all with solutions.It's like a
medicine whenever I solve some levels with much difficulty.It took me
sometimes, days before I solve it.If your interested in obtaining
solutions to some levels you can e-mail me together with a copy of the
levels you want to be solve.I would recommend to use the ysokoban
program because it is much easier to use and besides less tiring for
your hands because all you need to use is your mouse keys just click
the box and the destination and presto! it will go there to the
shortest possible route.besides you will be able to save your
solutions and go back to it in case you are wondering how you will be
able to solve it.I have gone also to some sokoban solutions site but
the one that I'm most interested to solve are not in their database.I
even downloaded some sokoban solver program but to my dismay some
failed to solve them even those that are easiest.So I make it a
challenge that those level which these solver were'nt able to solve.I
try to solve it myself.I get the feeling that If I solve some levels
which the computer failed to solve.I feel like superior to the
computer.So now here's your chance to solve that nagging levels which
even in your sleep still lingering in your mind.You can contact me at
this number 00639054446676 .I will give you my full support 24 hours a
day.I even convert levels from other sokoban games into txt or xsb
format.Pls specify which format you like to send to you.thank you.

This set was published progressively on the site of Paul Voyer, Gerald
Holler and Frantisek Pokorny. I wanted this set more difficult than
Microcosmos, but still with small levels. And why Nabokosmos ? Read
backwards "Som(e)sokoban";-) This set contains 2 levels "3boxes", 8
levels "4boxes", 21 levels "5boxes", 7 levels "6boxes" and 2 levels
"7boxes".

Novoban-1novoban.slc-2François Marques-3sokoban@online.fr-4http://sokoban.online.fr-5
This collection of 50 levels is intended for beginners. The difficulty
of the levels is increasing. The collection ends with some medium
levels. I submitted these problems to my 10 and 14 year old nephews
who completed all in one day (which is not bad at all for complete
beginners). However, if you are an expert, solving the whole
collection in less than 45 minutes is quite a challenge.
  
Numbers-1numbers.slc-2François Marques-3sokoban@online.fr-4http://sokoban.online.fr-5

difficulty of the levels varies. I think that you will be able to test
them profitably.

Side note. Level 2 was the exact copy of Infinity level 1180 or Aerie
level 10 (rotated 180 degrees and horizontally mirrored), and level 3
and 12 the remodels with practically the same solution as originals.
The actual author of these levels has resubmited the collection, with
these plagiat levels removed. Levels 13 to 17 are all remodels from
the collection Atroxija level 11. The author of the original, from
which these remodels were made, has labeled them as rem 1-5 or
remodels.

This is a set of 50 levels of variable difficulty. Some of them aren't
the greatest, hence the name, "Quagmire". Level #43 is a (harder?)
remake of Patera level #8. Comments are always appreciated.
  
Quagmire 2-1quagmire_2.slc-2Thomas Reinke-3thoms545@yahoo.com-4http://sapiens.ya.com/sokobanhomz-5
As with the first Quagmire set, there is a wide range of difficult,
although this set tends on the harder side. There are some recurring
themes throughout the levels, especially my recent infatuation with
nearly solved layouts.
  
Quagmire 3-1quagmire_3.slc-2Thomas Reinke-3thoms545@yahoo.com-4http://sapiens.ya.com/sokobanhomz-5

Several years in the making, with lots of breaks. My fascination with
patterns and symmetry continues, combined with a lot of nearly-solved
initial states. Hope you enjoy.

Sasquatch-1sasquatch.slc-2David W Skinner-3sasquatch98930@yahoo.com-4http://users.bentonrea.com/~sasquatch/sokoban/-5
Sasquatch (50 puzzles, released January, 1999) This is my first set.
Scott Lindhurst describes them as generally of just the right
difficulty to be fun: not too easy, but (usually) not so hard that you
get frustrated.
  
Sasquatch III-1sasquatchiii.slc-2David W Skinner-3sasquatch@bentonrea.com-4http://users.bentonrea.com/~sasquatch/sokoban/-5
Sasquatch III (50 puzzles, released June, 2000) This set ranges in
difficulty from medium to very hard. Thirtyone of these levels explore
some form of design symmetry. It is interesting (to me at least) to
solve levels in which sections are reversed or rotated. Each
transformation often suggests different approaches to the solution.
However, sometimes the confusion created requires that each section be
solved from scratch. Sometimes, I find levels in my earlier sets which
I would do differently today. Included here are improved versions of
two previous levels. Sasquatch III (41) = Mas Sasquatch (46) Sasquatch
III (48) = Sasquatch (49)
  
Sasquatch IV-1sasquatchiv.slc-2David W Skinner-3sasquatch@bentonrea.com-4http://users.bentonrea.com/~sasquatch/sokoban/-5
Sasquatch IV (50 puzzles, released March 2001) These range in
difficulty about like Sasquatch III. As always, I've tried to explore
a wide variety of puzzle types.
  
Sasquatch IX-1sasquatchix.slc-2David W Skinner-3sasquatch98930@yahoo.com-4http://users.bentonrea.com/~sasquatch/sokoban/-5
About one third of these are "normal" puzzles while the others are
"symetricals" with lots of squares, diamonds and other shapes.
Sasquatch IX #16 is an improved version of Sasquatch #15.
  
Sasquatch V-1sasquatchv.slc-2David W Skinner-3sasquatch@bentonrea.com-4http://users.bentonrea.com/~sasquatch/sokoban/-5
Sasquatch V (50 puzzles, released December, 2001) Again, a wide
variety. This set contains several puzzles which exceed the 31x18 size
limit of my previous sets.
  
Sasquatch VI-1sasquatchvi.slc-2David W Skinner-3sasquatch@bentonrea.com-4http://users.bentonrea.com/~sasquatch/sokoban/-5
Sasquatch VI (50 puzzles, released October, 2002) This set, is a
symmetrical feast. Forty of these levels involve some form of
symmetry. There is also a sequence of levels where I explore the
possibilities of working within squares of various sizes. This set
contains several puzzles which exceed the 31x18 size limit of my first
sets.
  
Sasquatch VII-1sasquatchvii.slc-2David W Skinner-3sasquatch98930@yahoo.com-4http://users.bentonrea.com/~sasquatch/sokoban/-5
Sasquatch VII (50 puzzles, released June 2004) This set has a lot of
symmetry but not as much as Sasquatch VI. I tried to do more "normal"
puzzles this time. It also contains more expreiments with squares plus
other shapes such as diamonds and a circle. As usual several oversize
puzzles are at the end of the set.
  
Sasquatch VIII-1sasquatchviii.slc-2David W Skinner-3sasquatch@bentonrea.com-4http://users.bentonrea.com/~sasquatch/sokoban/-5
50 puzzles, released March 2008. This set contains improved versions
of two previous levels. Sasquatch VIII #37 = Sasquatch #31 Sasquatch
VIII #38 = Mas Sasquatch #9
  
Sasquatch X-1sasquatchx.slc-2David W Skinner-3sasquatch@bentonrea.com-4http://users.bentonrea.com/~sasquatch/sokoban/-5

Sokoban Original Puzzles Tribute L-1sokoorigpuzzlestributelrg.slc-2Wayne Campbell-3asa.rand@gmail.com-4http://sokotribute.blogspot.com/-5
The other large format puzzles contain 25 levels including all 250
puzzles from the MS-DOS, Apple II, Commodore 64, Tandy Color Computer
and XSokoban variants. Due to restrictions in Sokoban for Windows,
this file contains only the 14 levels that differ from each other.
There are four puzzles that are not playable in each set. They are:
12, 13, 15 and 47. This is due to their designs requiring start
positions unreachable from anywhere outside their respective blocks.
These puzzles are shown in a overstated solution, including all boxes
(balls) and targets (goals) as boxes on targets. Differences between
variants is shown. The Commodore 64 variant of puzzle 42 is not
solvable. This error has existed since the game was released. This
puzzle is shown in overstated solution.
